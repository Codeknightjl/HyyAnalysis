# PyROOT Framework for ATLAS Open Data Analysis of Higgs to Two Photons Decay Channel

### Introduction
This framework analyzes the decay channel of a Higgs boson into two photons from the 13 TeV ATLAS Open Data. It uses the Python interfaced for ROOT known as [PyROOT](https://root.cern/manual/python/). This Python rendering is modified from the [C++ framework](https://github.com/atlas-outreach-data-tools/atlas-outreach-cpp-framework-13tev) released in the [13 TeV ATLAS Open Data documentation](http://opendata.atlas.cern/release/2020/documentation/index.html). It emulates the procedures used in actual High Energy Physics research.

### Analysis
This decay mode provides a clear signature of two isolated and energetic photons. The signal manifests itself as a narrow peak in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum on top of a smoothly falling background from QCD production of two photons. More information can be found in the official documentation. (see reference)

The procedures for the analysis:
 1. Apply the standard object-selection criteria and an event-selection criteria to identify the photons.
 2. Compare data and Monte-Carlo prediction for the distribution of the diphoton invariant mass spectrum.
 3. Find an excess of events (a bump) in the histogram of event distribution.
 4. The location of the excess of events gives the mass of the Higgs Boson.
